<h1>Stage 0: Topic Proposal</h1>

<div class="discription">
<section>
<p>Topic Overview: My idea is to create a web app that allows students or residents to buy, trade, or sell items locally. Also local business can offer thier goods and services on this web app. I got inspired by facebook market, but I wants to make a easier version for students to trade books, I think it also will help local business to grow.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>What else this app does: This web app also allows user to create "looking for an item". If the user is trying to look for something that is currently not on the web, they can create a notification, if there is someone else posting the item for sell, the app will notify the user.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>Advantage: This app allows local buyer and seller to do business. And It also allows seller to create bid, so whoever bid the highest is the winner. Same day pick up without any shipping fees.</p>

<p>My web compare to other similar sites</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> - allows customer to buy and sell, some of the item support one day delivery with higher shipping fees. My app allow faster and the customer can have same day pick up without paying shipping fees.</li>
<li><a href="www.ebdy.com">Ebay</a> - support bidding, but normally it takes close or over a month to get the item, because most of the sellers are oversea, the price tange is cheaper than amazon. My web its faster, and return will is easier.</li>
<li><a href="www.walmart.com">Walmart</a> - the biggest super market in the world, sometimes what the customer looking for its hard to find. And the overall services was not rating very high. My app allow use to give reviews to the seller.</li>
</ul>
